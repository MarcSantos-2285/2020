Geoprocessing and diagnostic tools scripted for Esri Support Services during my time as analyst are the property of Esri, as such I am unable to share the contents of those tools without express authorization from ESRI, Inc. 
What I can say that I have worked on/troubleshooted scripts that relate to the following items, some of which are publicly documented workflows:
-Diagnostic scripts for reviewing component logs and active python environments for Esri components
-"Print reports from ArcGIS Enterprise web apps": https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-enterprise/mapping/print-reports-from-arcgis-enterprise-web-apps/
-"Work with Python environments": https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/work-with-python-environments.htm
-publishing workflows
-Workflow Manager workflows
-generateToken workflows
-and others
